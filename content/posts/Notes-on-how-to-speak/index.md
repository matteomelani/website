### Notes on how to speak

These are notes for the leacture ["How to Speak"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY), lecture by Patrick Henry Winston.

#### Begin with an empowerment promise

Do not start with a joke as the audiance is not adjusted to your way of speaking. Instead starts with telling the audiance why they should listen to you for the next 45 minutes.

* What is your enpowering promise to them?
* What will the audiance know at the end of the talk that they do not know at the begining?

For example: "In the next 15 minutes, you will learn that many of the views about the world you consider to be truth are based on false premises. You will learn a new framework that will enpower you to see the world through facts based on data and numbers. You will finally see the world for what it really is."

Throughs in a shocking facts or statement to capture the audinace attention.

#### Repetita iuvant

Repeat your main argunment 3 to 5 times through the talk but do that in cycles: you present subarguments that supports part of your main argument and every time you conclude a subargument repeat the main argument.

#### Build a fence around your argument

Tell the audiance why your argument is different than existing ones. Your argument does not need to be new or original just different.

#### Do not leave any men behind

Adults attention span is about 5 minutes. Use verbal punctuation to re-engage the audiance every 5 minutes, you can do that with a joke or a question. When asking the question, studies showes you should wait at least 7 seconds for the audiance to respond.
Give also the audiance the opportunity to re-engage with the argument by summing up what you have told so far. Use an outline for exsmple.

#### Use the right tools

##### Room & Board
Make sure the audiance is in a very well lit room, that the room is proportional to the aiudiance size.
Use a board when you can.

#### Props
Use props, concrete, physical objects that will anchor in the audiance memory.
Do not use a laser pointer.

#### Slides
If you use slides, make sure to use the least amount of words, slides are there to support your talk, they are not the talk. Use images and charts to draw a point.
Humans cannot read and listen at the same time. So do not make the audiance do that.
Good fonts size are 40 to 50 to avoid to many words on the slides.
Do not use pointers, they are a distractions, they are a barrier to engage with the audiance.

### Informing

Start with a promise, new knowledge, it is all about the reader and what progress they are going to make by listening to your ideas.

Help them see a problem or the world in a new way

To Inspire:

* Tell how cool this stuff is
* Tell them they can do it
* Expresses passion

To teach how to think use stories, tell them the stories they need to know, tell them how to analyze stories, how to create new stories, questions to asks about stories.

### Persuading

* Practice with people that do not know what your are doing.
* Show vision and what you have done, your controbution, in 5 minutes.

Vision: problem audiance cares about, new approach.
Done something: show the steps to solve the problem you posed and tell which step you did.
Conclude by enumerating your controbution.

### Getting Famous

Your ideas are like children, you do not want them to go into the world with rags: packagin matters.
Here are the 5 attributes to great packing:

1. Symbol
2. Slogan
3. Surprise
4. Salient idea, one idea that sticks out
5. Stories, how you did it and why is important

### Finishing

Do not say thank you.
Do not show slides with: "Questions?", "The End", "Thank you".
End with your controbutions.
Finish with a joke.
