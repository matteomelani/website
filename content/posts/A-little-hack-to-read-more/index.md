### A little hack to read more

Reading books and long-form content is a very important tool to exercise the mind and its ability to focus; to learn new knowledge and to have fun. I cannot forget the pleasure of getting lost in Feynman's physics lectures or divouring one of Saramago's book during lazy Summer weekends.

But then, life happens: kids, Netflix, Twitter, errands, it has become so hard to find the same focus I use to take for granted just a few years back. Sure, I still have it when coding but that's about it.

I have tried many strategies but unlike writting, exercising or dieting I find reading easy to start but really challenging to continue. At each session, I find myself starting and stopping three or four times and after 30 minutes I usually give up. 60 minutes sessions are rare and require extreme effort. It is not fun. And this happens even if the content is interesting!

Starting this week, I am trying a new approach: I am thinking about reading not like a passive exercise but like dynamic one

reading = knowledge/story line tinckering.

Since my brain learn the fastest by tinckering I want to see what happens if I think about reading as a tickering exercise and not a passive act of listening.

Fist, I am going to start taking notes and scribbling around the margins of the book or a piece of paper.

Seconds, just like I use to do when reading physics books, I am going to visualize, realaborate and play with knowledge and story lines.

Third, I am going to constately synthetize, abstract and summerize.

In other words, I am going to try a much more active approach rather than a passive one.  

Let's see if I can increase the frequency and duration of the sessions.

Let the experiement begin!
