### One sentence a day

I decided to improve my writing so my goal is to write at least a sentence a day for the next 4 weeks. It does not matter what I write as long as it is original and it is published on the Web.

Why do I want to improve my writing?

1. Writing improves clarity of thinking: in order to write an argument you need evaluate your assumptions, clearly express your premise, neatly layout the argument parts following a logical path and finally present the conclusion. You need to think and do it well. 

2. Writing is the same as teaching: it forces you to breakdown a subject to its fundamental components and understand how they are linkedin together.

3. I need to feel in control of my own thoughts: lately I have been distracted and uncapable to focus very well. Writing, like coding helps me "to get sucked in", to get in the zone.

Why a sentence a day?

The most difficult thing in writting is to get started. After failing many times I want to try the same approach I have used successfully with studing, coding, exercising and dieting: showing up everyday without worrieng about the result. Just show up! 

Why do I want to publish it?

Because it forces me to focus and it helps me win the fear of putting my thoughts out there which it means I am afraid I am not a good writer and that I don't have anything interesting to say.
