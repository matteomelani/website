### One sentence a day

I decided to improve my writing. My goal is to write at least a sentence a day for the next 4 weeks. It doesn't matter what I write as long as it is original and published on the Web.

#### Why do I want to improve my writing?

1. Writing improves clarity of thinking: to write an argument you need to evaluate your assumptions, clearly express your premises, neatly layout the argument parts and finally present the conclusion. You need to think and do it well.

2. Writing, as teaching, forces you to breakdown a subject to its fundamental components and understand how they fit together.

3. I need to feel in control of my own thoughts: lately I have been distracted and uncapable of focusing well. Writing, like coding, helps me "get sucked in", get in the zone.

#### Why a sentence a day? 

The most difficult thing in writting is to get started. After failing many times I'll try the same approach used successfully with studing, coding, exercising and dieting: showing up everyday without worrying about the result. Just show up!

#### Why do I want to publish it?

Because it forces me to focus and it helps me win the fear of putting my thoughts out there which it means I am afraid I am not a good writer and that I don't have anything interesting to say.
