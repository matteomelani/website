### Doing the startup thing

Today I had a chat with a collogue, he is a bright young man with a BS in computer science from a top school. His plan is to work at Facebook for a couple of years and than to do a start up.

But why? Why do we want to do a start up? And what's a good reason to start one?


Why did I start a startup?

The first startup I joined what Paperlit in May 2010. Gionata, a friend of mine had just started the company. He had some traction and he had raised $150k or so. He was looking for a co-founder so I quit my job at Microsoft and I joined Paperlit as a co-founder for 10% of the company vested over 4 years. I followed Gionata purly out of sense of adventure. It was a completely irrational decision. At Microsoft, I was boared and tired of my engineering manger job. I knew nothing about the economics of startups, I knew nothing about the product we were building - a software platform to publish digital newspapers and magazine on iOS devices and the Web -  and its market. I certanely did not understand the trend we were riding - smart phones and cloud computing.
I did even know much the technology. But I knew I wanted the opportunity, the dream of creating a rocket ship, the adventure or risking it all. 
I left Paperlit after five months. Gionata moved to Italy, he scaled the business to a few million in ARR and 20 employees. In 2018 he sold the company to another startup.

So what would I tell Matteo if I could talk to him in 2010?

First, understand the business of ventue capital.
Limited Partners (LPs) are people with a lot of money to invest. Their job is to allocate money across various investment types, each type with a different risk/return profile. LPs invest part of their capital in venture funds because they seek high-risk / high return.
General Partners (GPs) are the ones that decide what venture to funds. These are the folks that you talk to when you are raising money for your startup.

So let's say that Jack and Mark believe they have a great eye to spot the next startups that will become massive businesses. Jack and Mark decide to raise a venture fund. Armed with an investment thesis. Mark and Jack  pitch their idea to people with a lot of money and ask them to invest to become Limited Partners in their fund. Mark and Jack business proposition to the investors sounds more or less like this: "We are raising $100M funds to invest in tech startups and we can pick the winners because of this or that insight. We are putting $10M of our own money in the fund, and raising $90M, we will operate the funds and make all the investiment decisions, we will return your 100x the investment in 10 years. In excahnge we will charge 2% of the money you invest (the management fee) and 20% of the profit (the carry)."
