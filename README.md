## Quick start

Compile all src files to generate the website:
```
gatsby develop
```

/public => generated website

`http://localhost:8000` => view site

`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

## Deploy

Just push to master and AWS Amplify does the rest.
